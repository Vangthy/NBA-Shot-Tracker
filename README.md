# How to use:
1. Run the program
2. Input the player's name (It could just be their first or last name, and it will give you a list to pick from. Typing the players full name will just give you the player)
3. Input the the season that you want from the player (ex. 1999-00). (Shots started being tracked in the 1996-97 season, so seasons before will print a empty shot chart. It will print their stats and the team they played for in the console)
